## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide clear insights into loan disbursement trends across branches, states, and vehicle manufacturers.  
- Profile customers by demographics, employment type, and documentation completeness.  
- Identify behavioral and credit bureau factors linked to loan defaults.  
- Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of loan default.  
- Integrate predictions into Power BI for actionable decision-making dashboards.
